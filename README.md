## Haraj Challenge
Welcome to Haraj challenge!

In this repository you will find a sample app ready for implementation. 

You will find icons and a json file containing the data you'll need to complete this challenge.


## Your Mission

Create a functional app with two screens to display information about Posts from Haraj website.

First, a screen showing a list of Posts from the json file you'll find in `assets` folder.

Second, a screen that displays the information of a particular Post upon click events on the previous screen's list.

<img src="image2.png" height="450" alt="Second Screen">

The share button should open up Android's native share sheet to share the title of the Post with other apps.

As required, I made two screen with one for listing and the other for details. Some feature you might find interesting:
- Searchable result
- Clickable common number pattern (such as phone number, email, etc)
- Share function
- Testable Code (which includes Unit Test that you cna try yourself)

You can also try this directly by downloading the APK from the release page.

- Following common design patterns (preferably MVVM).
- Clean and testable code.
- Lightweight UI (avoid nested views)
